1 = 1 and no more

Project  *--1 Deadline
Project  *--1 Department
Project  *--* People (resources)

Each project can have
	1 deadline
	1 Department
	Many people Assigned to it.

Each Department can have
	Many projects
		with 1 deadline
	Many People

Each Person
	1 Department
	Many projects
		with one deadline
		
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Background:
	Given that each Department can own zero or many Projects
	And each Resource can be assigned to zero or more Projects
	And Projects can have zero or more Resources assigned to them
	And each Deadline can imposed on zero or more Projects
	But each Project can only be given one Deadline
	But each Project can only be associated with one Department

Feature: An Auto-updating Three-level Hierarchical List
	The application will create and maintain one hierarchical list.
	The list supports three levels
	The list is made from elements in the arrays in originalDataset.

	The application may use whatever controls the programmer sees fit 
	in order to assign and assemble the four categories of data into the hierarchy.
	The application must link to or render these controls on every page.

	The application must always respect the entity/relation rules above.  
	The application must remove as well as add entities to the nodes in the list.
	The application should immediately reflect additions or removals to the list.
	The application always respects sorts, routing rules and constraints.
	The application will 
	- notify if the user attempts a move that breaks the rules and abort the move
	- and/or correctly prevent rulebreaking moves in the control set

	Using angular routing, the application will assign 
	- Deadline, 
	- Department or 
	- Project 
	as the primary level in the list
 
 	If there is no routing token, Department will be the default.
 	The application will sort the primary category in descending order.   

	Using angular routing, the application will allow a secondary, descending sort:
	the number of resources assigned to each project.   
	In the secondary sort view, clicking in a project's property list re-routes
	to a single project view

	In the single project view, the full property and resource list will show
	In the single project view, there will be a link back 
	to the current primary and secondary sort
